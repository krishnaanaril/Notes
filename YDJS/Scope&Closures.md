## Compiler Theory
1. **Tokenizing/Lexing:** breaking up a string of characters into meaningful (to the language) chunks, called tokens. 
2. **Parsing:** taking a stream (array) of tokens and turning it into a tree of nested elements, which collectively represent the grammatical structure of the program. This tree is called an **"AST"**(Abstract Syntax Tree).
3. **Code-Generation:** the process of taking an AST and turning it into executable code. 

**Note:** LHS and RHS meaning "left/right-hand side of an assignment" doesn't necessarily literally mean "left/right side of the = assignment operator". There are several other ways that assignments happen, and so it's better to conceptually think about it as: "who's the target of the assignment (LHS)" and "who's the source of the assignment (RHS)".

**Note:**  It's not really appropriate to think of a function declaration as an LHS look-up assignment in the way we're discussing them here.
