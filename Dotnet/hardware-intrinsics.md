# Hardware Intrinsics

- Vectorization is a name used for applying the same operation to multiple elements of an array simultaneously.
- On the x86/x64 platform, vectorization can be achieved by using Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) CPU instructions to operate on array-like objects.
- SSE & AVX are the names for SIMD instruction set extensions to the x86 architecture. 
- AVX's key advantage is that it can handle 8 consecutive 32-bit elements in memory in one instruction, twice as much as SSE can.
