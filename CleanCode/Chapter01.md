## Chapter 01 - Clean Code

* Programmers should convey the challenges to the managers. It is too unprofessional to bend to the will of managers who don't understand the risks of making messes. An analogy of developer as doctor and manager as patient is presented and made a lot of sense. 
* The only way to go fast is to keep the code as clean as possible.
* Quoting Bjourne Stroustrap - Bad code tries to do so much, clean code is focused and elegant.
* Developer spend a lot of time reading the code. So If he/she want to go fast, make it easy to read.
* The Boy Scout Rule: Leave the campground cleaner that you found it.

## Chapter 02 - Meaningful Names

* Use Intention - Revealing Names
* If a name requires a comment, then name doesn't reveal its intent.
* Avoid disinformation - Programmers must avoid leaving false clues that obscure the meaning of code. 
* Make meaningful distinctions - Developers create problems for themselves, when they write code to satisfy a compiler or interpreter. Distinguish names in such a way that the reader know what the differences offer.
* User pronounceable names - 
* Use searchable names - Single letter names and numeric constants have a particular problem in that they are not easy to  locate across a body of text. **The length of a name should correspond to the size of its scope**
* Avoid encodings
* You should be using an editing environment that highlights or colorizes members to make them distinct.
* Avoid mental mapping - Prefer clarity over smartness.
* Classes and Objects should have noun or noun phrases. A class name should not be a verb.
* Methods should have verb or verb phrase names.
* Don't be cute - Avoid fancy naming conventions. Say what you mean and mean what you say.
* Pick one work per concept. Eg. avoid the use of fetch, retrieve and get for the same concept in different contexts.
* Use solution domain names & problem domain names based on the context.
