- In any organization, in any company, in any group, any country and even any continent, what level of technical capability, do we need to retain? How technical do we need to stay to remain viable as a company or a country or a continent? And is there a point of no return?
- If you outsource too much? Is there a point where you cannot go back and relearn how actually making things work?
- If as a company you have outsourced too much. No good engineer will still want to work for your company. The smart people will not work for your company, because you have turned into a marketing and financing exercise. And the smart engineers, they want to build better toasters, they want to touch actual stuff. So the thing is, there is a point of no return.
- Boeing at some point, [outsourced](https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.documentcloud.org/documents/69746/hart-smith-on-outsourcing.pdf) almost everything and they ran into trouble, they had this long before the 737 MAX. Boeing was already busy outsourcing everything. And when they built the 787 Dreamliner, they found that all they were doing was drawing designs and then handing them to manufacturers.
- In the end, you cannot survive if all you create is intellectual property.
- At some point, your technical contribution as a company becomes a negative and that’s the point of no return. Because then also no good technical person wants to work there anymore.
- Shareholders are actually very happy with that. And how did that happen? It’s mostly pension funds. And index trackers, if you look at who are the actual shareholders of big companies, they are all big pension funds, and they don’t really care. They want the share price and dividend to go up, for now. But in the longer term, they are not strategically interested in the company, because if the company doesn’t do well, they will invest in another company.
- There is a polarization in many companies and organizations where the technical people are all convinced that the management people are all stupid.
- Technical people hate sitting in meetings, and hate doing actual management things. So if you do not show up at the meeting, do not be surprised if the company or organization makes choices that you’re not happy with. 
- If you work at a big technical company and it’s not doing the right things, then we also must do something.
