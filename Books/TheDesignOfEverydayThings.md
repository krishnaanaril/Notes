# The Design Of Everyday Things - Don Norman

## Chapter 1: The Pshychopathology of Everyday Things

- The major areas of desing relevant to the book are **industrial** design, **interactive** design and **experience** design. None of the fields are well defined. Industrial designers emphasize on form and material, Interactive designers emphasize on understandability and usability, and Experience designers emphasize on emotional impact.
- **Human-centered Design (HCD)** is an approach that puts human needs, capabilities and behaviour first, then designs to accommodate those needs, capabilities and ways of behaving. 
- Six fundamental psychological concepts:
    1. Affordances
    2. Signifiers
    3. Constraints
    4. Mappings
    5. Feedback 
    6. Conceptual Model 
- An **affordance** is a relationship between the properties of an object and the capabilities of the agent that determines how the object could possible be used. 
- **Signifiers** signal things, in particular what actions are possible and how they should be done. Signifiers must be perceivable, else they fail to function. A signifier can be words (like ‘push’), a graphical illustration, or just a device whose perceived affordances are unambiguous.
- **Mappings**: A device is easy to use wen the set of possible actions is visible, when the controls and displays exploit natural mappings. As an eg. Layout of the switch matching the layout of lights.
- **Feedback**: Communicating the results of an action. Feedback must be immediate, even a delay of a tenth of a second can be disconcerting. But too much feedback can be annoying.
-	A **conceptual model** is an explanation, usually highly simplified of how something works. It doesn’t have to be complete or even accurate as long as it is useful. 
- A **System Image** is formed by the combined information available to us in the form of physical appearance, sales literature, and other similar products in the market. 
- Designers expect the user’s conceptual model to be identical to their own, but because they cannot communicate directly with the user, the burden of communication is with the system image.
- The same technology that simplifies life by providing more functions in each device also complicates life by making the device harder to learn, harder to use. This is the paradox of technology and the challenge for the designer.
