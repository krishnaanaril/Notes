## Management 101

### What to expect from a manager?

1. One-on-One meetings

    * 1-1s server two purposes. First, they create a human connection between you and your manager. Second, it provides a regular opportunity for you to speak privately with your manager about whatever needs discussing.
    * Share the responsibility of having good 1-1s and come up with an agenda of things you would like to discuss.

2. Feedback and workplace guidance

    * This is not preformance reviews, but behavioural feedback.
    * If you are at a company with a career ladder, sitting down with your manager and asking her what areas you need to focus on to get promoted is usually a good idea if you are actively looking for promotion. 
    * As you become more senior expect the type of feedback to change from personal to team or strategy-related input

3. Training and career growth

    * Your manager should have an idea of whether you are qualified to be promoted.
