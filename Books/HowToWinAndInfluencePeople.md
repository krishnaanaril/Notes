1.  Begin with praise and honest appreciation.
2.  Call attentin to people's mistakes indirectly.
3.  Talk about your own mistakes before criticizing the other person.
4.  Ask questions instead of giving direct orders.
5.  Let the other person save face.
6.  Prasise the slightest improvement and praise every improvement. Be "hearty in your appreciation and lavish in your praise".
7. Give the other person a finer reputation to live up to.
8. Use encouragement. Make the fault seem easy to correct.
9. Make the other person happy about doing the thing you suggest.
