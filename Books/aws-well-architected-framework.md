# AWS Well-Architected Framework

* The AWS Well-Architected Framework is based on five pillars:
    - Operational Excellency
    - Security
    - Reliability
    - Performance Efficiency
    - Cost Optimization
* A **component** is the code, configuration, and AWS resources that together deliver against a requirement.
* The term **workload** is used to identify a set of components that together deliver a business value.
* **Milestones** mark key changes in your architecture as it evolves throughout the product life cycle.
* Security and Operational Excellency are not usually traded-off against other pillars.
