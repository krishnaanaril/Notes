# Never Split The Difference - Chris Voss

## Chapter 2 - Be a Mirror

- A good negotiator prepares, going in, to be ready for possible surprises; a great negotiator aims to use her skills to reveal the surprises she is certain to find.
- Don't commit to assumptions; instead, view them as hypotheses and use the negotiation to test them rigorously.
- Negotiation is not an act of battle; it's a process of discovery. The goal is to uncover as much information as possible.
- To quite your voices in the head, make your sole and all encompassing focus the other person and what they have to say.
- Slow. It. Down. If you are in a hurry, people can feel as if they are not being heard.
- Put a smile on your face. When people are in a positive frame of m ind, they think more quickly, and are more likely to collaborate and problem solve.
- There are three voice tones available to negotiators:
    - The late-night FM DJ voice: Use selectively to make a point. Keep calm and slow.
    - The positive/playful voice: Should be your default voice. The key here is to relax and smile while you're talking
    - The direct or assertive voice: Used rarely.
- Mirrors work magic. Use mirrors to encourage the other side to empathize and bond with you.

## Chapter 3 - Don't feel their pain. Label it.

- By acknowledging other person's situation, you immediately convey that you are listening. And once they know you are listening, they will tell you something that you can use.
- The reasons why your counterpart will not make an agreement are often more powerful than why they will make a deal, so focus on first clearing the barriers to agreement.
- Pause. After you label a barrier or mirror a statement. Let it sink in.
- Label your counterpart's fear to diffuse their power. The faster you interpret the action in your coutnerpart's amygdala, the faster you can generate feelings of saftey, well-being and trust.
- List the worst things that the other party could say about you and say them before the other person can (**Accusation audit**). And because these accusations sound exaggerated when said aloud, speaking them will encourage the other person to claim that quite the opposite is true.
- Use labels to reinforce and encourage positive perceptions and dynamics as the other person usually wants to be appreciated and understood.

## Chapter 4 - Beware "Yes" - Master "No"

- Break the habit of attempting to get people to say "yes". Being pushed for "yes" makes people defensive.
- "No" is not a failure. Learn how to hear it calmly. It is not the end of the negotiation, but the beginning.
- "Yes" is the final goal of a negotiation, but don't aim for it at the start.
- Saying "No" makes the speaker feel safe, secure, and in control so **trigger** it. That's why "Is now a bad time to talk?" is always better than "Do you have a few minutes to talk?"
- Sometimes the only way to get your conterpart to listen and engage with uou is by forcing them into a "No." That means intentionally mislableing one of their emotions or desires or asking a ridiculous question that can only be anwered negatively like "It seems like you want this project to fail?"
- Negotiate in their world. Persuation is not about how bright or smooth or forceful you are. It's about the other party convincing themselves that the solution you want is their own idea. So don't beat them with logic or brute force. Ask them questions that open paths to your goals.
- If a potential business partner is ignoring ou, contact them with a clear and concise "No" oriented question that suggests that you are ready to walk away.

## Chapter 5 - Trigger the two words that immediately transform any negotiation

- Tactics in active listening arsenal:
    - Effective Pauses
    - Minimal encouragers
    - Mirroring
    - Labeling
    - Paraphrase
    - Summarize
- Creating unconditional positive regard opens the door so changing thoughts and behaviors. The more a person feels understood, and positively affirmed in that understanding, the more likely that urge for constructive behavior will take hold.
- "That's right" is better than "yes". Strive for it.
- Use a sumnmary to trigger a "that's right". 

## Chapter 6 - Bend their reality

- Know the emotional drivers and you can frame the benefits of any deal in language that will resonate.
- Prospect theory (proposed by Daniel Kahneman) argues that people are drawn to sure things over probabilities, even though probability is a better choice. That's called the *Certainity Effect*
- In a tough negotiation, It is not enough to show the other party that you can deliver the thing they want. To get real leverage, you have to persuade them that they have something concrete to lose if the deal falls though. People will take more risks to avoid a loss than to realize a gain.
- Bend their reality
    1. Anchor their emotions
    2. Let the other guy go first...most of the time.
    3. Establish a range
    4. Pivot to nonmonetary terms
    5. When you do talk numbers, use odd ones.
    6. Surprise with a gift.
- **Anchor their emotions** - Start with an accusation audit of all their fears. By anchoring their emotions in preparation for a loss, you inflame the other side's loss aversion so that they'll jump at the chance to avoid it.
- **Let the other guy go first...most of the time.** - You've got to be careful why you let the other guy anchor. Find a balance in anchoring, otherwise it'll ruin your reputation.
- **Establish a range** - If you offer a range expect them to come in at the low end.
- **Pivot to nonmonetary terms** - Make your counterpart brainstorm to see what valuable nonmonetary gems they might've that are cheap to them but valuable to me.
- **When you do talk numbers, use odd ones.** - Numbers that end in 0 inevitably feel like temporary placeholders.
- **Surprise with a gift.** - You can get your counterpart into a mood of generosity by staking an extreme anchor and then, after their inevitable first rejection, offering them a wholly unrelated suprise gift. They will suddenly come up on their offer, or they'll look to repay your kindness in the future. People feel obliged to repay debts of kindness.
- How to negotiate a better salary?
    - Be pleasantly persistent on nonsalary terms - The more you talk about nonsalary terms, the more likely you are to hear the full range of their options. If they can't meet your nonsalary requests, they may even counter with more money.
    - Salary terms without success terms is russian roulette - Once you've negotiated a salary, make sure to defien success for your position - as well as metrics for your next raise.
    - Spark their interest in your success and gain an unofficial mentor - What does it take to be successful here?
- All negotiations are defined by a networkof subterranean desiers and needs. Don't let yourself be fooled by the surface.
- Approaching deadlines entice people to rusht he negotiating process and do impulsive things that are against their best interests.

## Chapter 7 - Create the illusion of control

- Don't try to force your opponent to admit that you are right. Aggressive confrontation is the enemy of constructive negotiation.
- Avoid questions that can be answered with "Yes" or tiny pieces of information. You'll be expected to give something back.
- Ask calibrated questions that start with the words "How" or "What". By implicitly asking the other party for help, these questions will give your counterpart an illusion of control and will inspire them to speak at length, revelaing importnat information.
- Don't ask questions that start with "Why". "Why" is always an accusation, in any language.
- Calibrate your questions to point your counterpart toward solving your problem.
- When you are attacked in a negotiation, pause and avoid angry emotional reactions. Instead, ask your counterpart a calibrated question.
- There is always a teaam on the other side. If you are not influencing those behind the table, you are vulnerable.
