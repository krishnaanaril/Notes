# How To Talk so Kids Will Listen and Listen so Kids will Talk - Adele Faber & Elaine Mazlish

## 1. Helping Children Deal with Their Feelings
- Children need to have their feelings accepted and respected.
- To help with feelings
  - You can listen quitely and attentively
  - You can acknowledge their feelings with a word. eg: "Oh...mm.. I see.."
  - You can give he feeling a name. eg: "That sounds frustrating"
  - You can give the child his whishes in fantasy.
- What people of all ages can use in a moment of distress is not agreeemnt or disagreement; they need someone to recognize what it is they're experiencing.
## 2. Engaging Cooperation
- To engage a child's copoperation
  - Describe what you see, or describe the problem. eg: " there's a wet towel on the bed"
  - Give information. eg: "The towel is getting my blanket wet"
  - Say it with a word. eg: "The towel"
  - Describe what you feel. eg: "I don't like sleeping in a wet bed!"
  - Write a note. eg: (Above towel rack) Please put me back here - Thanks, Your Towel
## 3. Alternatives to Punishment
- Instead of punishment:
  - Express your feelings strongly - without attacking character. eg: "I'm furious that my new saw was left outside to rust  in the rain"
  - State your expectations. eg: "I expect the tools to be returned after they've been borrowed"
  - Show the child how to make amends. eg: "What this saw needs now is a little steel wook and a lot of elbow grease."
  - Offer a choice. eg: "You can borrow my tools and return them or you can give up the privilege of using them. You decide."
  - Take action. Allow the child to experience the consequences of his/her behaviour.
  - Problem solve

  1. Talk about your child's feelings and needs.
  2. Talk about your feelings and needs.
  3. Brainstorm together to find a mutually agreeable solution
  4. Write down all ideas - without evaluationg
  5. Decide which plan to follow through on.
## 4. Encouraging Autonomy
- To encourage autonomy
  - Let childer make choices. eg: "Are you in the mood for your gray pants or your red pants"
  - Show respect for a child's struggle. eg: "A jar can be hard to open. Sometime you tap the lid with a spoon".
  - Don't ask too many questions
  - Don't rush to answer questions. eg: "That's an interesting question. What do you think?"
  - Encourage children to use sources outside the home. eg: "Maybe the pet shop owner would have some suggestions"
  - Don't take away hope. eg: "So you're thinking of trying out for the play! That should be an experience."
- More ways to encourage autonomy

  - Stay out of the minutiae of a child's life.
  - Don't talk about a child in front of him - Not matter how young the child.
  - Let the child answer for herself.
  - Show respect for your child's eventual readiness
  - Watch out ofr too many "Nos".
- Some alternatives to "No"
  - Give information
  - Accept feelings
  - Describe the problem
  - When possible, substitute a "Yes" for a "No"
  - Give yourself time to think
## 5. Praise
- Instead of evaluating ("Good"..."Great!"), Describe.
  - Describe what you see. eg: "I see a clean floor, a smooth bed and the books are neatly lined up  on the shelf."
  - Describe what you feel.
  - Sum up the child's praiseworthy behavior with a word. eg: "You sorted out the toys in separate boxes. That's what i call *organization*"
- Some cautions about praise
  - Make sure your praise is appropriate to your child's age and level of ability.
  - Avoid the kind of praise that hints at past weaknesses or past failures.
  - Be aware that excessive enthusiasm can interfere witha  child's desire to accomplish for herself.
  - Be prepared for a lot of repetition of the same activity when you describe what a child  is doing appreciatively.
## 6. Freeing Children from Playing Roles
- To free children form playing roles:
  - Look for opportunities to show the child a new picture of him/herself. eg: "You've had that toy since you were three and it almost looks like new"
  - Put children in situations where they can see themselves differnetly.
  - Let children overhear you say something positive about them
  - Model the behaviour you'd like to see. eg: "It's had to lose, but I'll try to be a port about it. Congratulations"
  - Be a storehouse for your child's special moments. eg: "I remember the time you..."
  - When you r child acts according the old label, state your feelings and/or your expectations. eg: "I don't like that. Despite your strong feelings, I expect sportsmanship from you."
