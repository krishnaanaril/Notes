# Trading Systems

- A **buy-side** firm is a financial institution that buys securities, assets, or investments on behalf of itself or its clients. These firms aim to generate returns by investing in the market.
- In simple terms:
    - Buy-side = Investors
        - Goal: Maximise returns
        - Eg: Mutual Funds, Pension Funds, Hedge Funds
    - Sell-side = Brokers / Advisors
        - Goal: earn fees/commission
        - Eg: Investment banks, brokerages

- Investment Lifecycle: End‑to‑End Overview
    - An investment firm—whether a bank, asset manager, or hedge fund—follows a lifecycle from **idea → execution → monitoring → settlement → reporting**.
- **VWAP** (Volume-Weighted Average Price) and **TWAP** (Time-Weighted Average Price) are algorithmic trading benchmarks that break large orders into smaller chunks to minimize market impact, but VWAP weights trades by volume for a price reflecting actual market activity, making it better for liquid assets, while TWAP distributes trades evenly over time, focusing on stealth for illiquid or volatile markets. VWAP adapts to trading patterns, while TWAP provides a predictable execution schedule, ideal for consistent buying/selling or avoiding price distortion. 
- VaR - Value at Risk - In trading, Value at Risk (VaR) is a statistical measure estimating the maximum potential loss a portfolio could face over a specific time (e.g., 1 day, 1 week) with a certain probability (e.g., 95%, 99%) under normal market conditions, answering, "How much could I lose?"
