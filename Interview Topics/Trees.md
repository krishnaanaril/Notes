# Trees

## Key properties that every red-black tree maintains
1. **Node Color:** Every node is either red or black.
2. **Root Property:** The root of the tree is always black.
3. **Red Node Property:** Red nodes cannot have red children (i.e., no two red nodes can be adjacent).
4. **Black Depth Property:** Every path from a node to its descendant NULL nodes has the same number of black nodes.
5. **Leaf Nodes:** All leaves (NIL or NULL) are considered black.
