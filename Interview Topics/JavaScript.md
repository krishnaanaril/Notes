- **All declarations** (`var`, `let`, `const`, `function`, `function*`, class) are "hoisted" in JavaScript.
- The difference between `var`/`function`/`function*` declarations and `let`/`const`/`class` declara­tions is the initialisation. The former are initialised with `undefined` while the late is *uninitialised*.
- `let` and `const` are hoisted (like `var`, `class` and `function`), but there is a period between entering scope and being declared where they cannot be accessed. This period is the **temporal dead zone (TDZ)**.
- ECMAScript 6 offers **tail call optimization**, where you can make some function calls without growing the call stack.
- The JavaScript **event loop** takes the first call in the callback queue and adds it to the call stack as soon as it's empty.
- The **job queue**, also known as the *promise queu*e, has priority over the callback queue. The event loop will take calls from the promise queue first before processing the callback queue.
- Callback queue is also known as **Task** queue. Job queue is also know as **Microtask** queue.
- With arrow functions, the `this` keyword refers to its current surrounding scope, unlike regular functions!
- In JavaScript, all object keys are strings (unless it's a Symbol).
- Neither static methods nor static properties can be called on instances of the class.
- If you want a method to be available to all object instances, you have to add it to the prototype property.
-  When using `new`, `this` refers to the new empty object we create. However, if you don't add `new`, `this` refers to the global object!
- All objects have prototypes, except for the base object. 
- A very few objects, including `Object.prototype` itself, do not inherit from anything. This will only occur if the object is explicitly created with `Object.create(null)`.
- The strings and placeholders get passed to a function — either a default function, or a function you supply. To supply a function of your own, precede the template literal with a function name; the result is called a **tagged template**.
- When testing equality, primitives are compared by their value, while objects are compared by their reference. JavaScript checks if the objects have a reference to the same location in memory.
- An array is an object type.
- The data stored in `sessionStorage` is removed after closing the tab.
- With the `var` keyword, you can declare multiple variables with the same name.
- If you have two keys with the same name, the key will be replaced. It will still be in its first position, but with the last specified value.
- During event propagation, there are 3 phases: capturing, target, and bubbling. 
- You can stop bubbling by `event.stopPropagation`.
- The `apply()` method calls the specified function with a given `this` value, and arguments provided as an array (or an array-like object).
- The `call()` method calls the function with a given `this` value and arguments provided individually.
- The `bind()` method creates a new function that, when called, has its `this` keyword set to the provided value, with a given sequence of arguments preceding any provided when the new function is called.
- There are only 7 built-in types: `null`, `undefined`, `boolean`, `number`, `string`, `object`, and `symbol`. "function" is not a type, since functions are objects, it's of type "object".
- `setInterval()` returns a unique id. This id can be used to clear that interval with the `clearInterval()` function.
- Regular functions cannot be stopped mid-way after invocation. However, a generator function can be "stopped" midway, and later continue from where it stopped.
- With a `for-in` loop, we can iterate through object keys.
- Arguments are passed by value, unless their value is an object, then they're passed by reference.
- An exception can be a string, a number, a boolean or an object.
- When we try to invoke something that is not a `function`, a `TypeError` is thrown.
- An imported module is read-only: you cannot modify the imported module. Only the module that exports them can change its value.
- The `delete` operator returns a boolean value: `true` on a successful deletion, else it'll return `false`.
- Variables declared with the `var`, `const` or `let` keyword cannot be deleted using the `delete` operator.
- With the `defineProperty` method, we can add new properties to an object, or modify existing ones. When we add a property to an object using the `defineProperty` method, they are by default not enumerable. The `Object.keys` method returns all enumerable property names from an object.
- The first argument that the `reduce` method receives is the *accumulator*. The second argument is the *current value*.
- In a derived class, you cannot access the `this` keyword before calling `super`. If you try to do that, it will throw a `ReferenceError`. 
- With the `import` keyword, all imported modules are *pre-parsed*. This means that the imported modules get run *first*, the code in the file which imports the module gets executed *after*.
- An async function always returns a promise. 
- When we create the variable `shape` and set it equal to the frozen object `box`, `shape` also refers to a frozen object. 
- You can check whether an object is frozen by using `Object.isFrozen`.
- With a `for-in` loop, we can iterate over enumerable properties. In an array, the enumerable properties are the "keys" of array elements, which are actually their indexes.
- With a `for-of` loop, we can iterate over iterables.
- By default, arguments have the value of `undefined`.
- You can set a default parameter's value equal to another parameter of the function, as long as they've been defined before the default parameter.
- Calling a function constructor with `new` results in the creation of an instance of `function`, `typeof` keyword returns "object" for an instance.
- Regular functions have a `prototype` property, which is an `object` (prototype object) with a `constructor` property. Arrow functions however do not have this `prototype` property. `undefined` gets returned when trying to access the `prototype` property.
- The rest parameter's value is an array containing all remaining arguments, and **can only be the last parameter**.
- In JavaScript, we don't have to write the semicolon (;) explicitly, however the JavaScript engine still adds them after statements. This is called **Automatic Semicolon Insertion**. 
- We can set classes equal to other classes/function constructors. 
- A `Symbol` is not enumerable. The `Object.keys` method returns all enumerable key properties on an object. The `Symbol` won't be visible, and an empty array is returned. 
- With arrow functions, we don't have to write curly brackets if we just return one value. However, if you want to instantly return an object from an arrow function, you have to write it between parentheses.
- **TypeErrors** get thrown when a value is not of the expected type.
- **SyntaxErrors** get thrown when you've written something that isn't valid JavaScript.
- **ReferenceErrors** get thrown when JavaScript isn't able to find a reference to a value that you're trying to access.
- With the JSON.parse() method, we can parse JSON string to a JavaScript value.
- With the `yield` keyword, we yield values in a generator function. With the `yield*` keyword, we can yield values from another generator function, or iterable object (for example an array).
