- **All declarations** (`var`, `let`, `const`, `function`, `function*`, class) are "hoisted" in JavaScript.
- The difference between `var`/`function`/`function*` declarations and `let`/`const`/`class` declara­tions is the initialisation. The former are initialised with `undefined` while the late is *uninitialised*.
- `let` and `const` are hoisted (like `var`, `class` and `function`), but there is a period between entering scope and being declared where they cannot be accessed. This period is the **temporal dead zone (TDZ)**.
- ECMAScript 6 offers **tail call optimization**, where you can make some function calls without growing the call stack.
- The JavaScript **event loop** takes the first call in the callback queue and adds it to the call stack as soon as it's empty.
- The **job queue**, also known as the *promise queu*e, has priority over the callback queue. The event loop will take calls from the promise queue first before processing the callback queue.
- Callback queue is also known as **Task** queue. Job queue is also know as **Microtask** queue.
- With arrow functions, the `this` keyword refers to its current surrounding scope, unlike regular functions!
- In JavaScript, all object keys are strings (unless it's a Symbol).
- Neither static methods nor static properties can be called on instances of the class.
- If you want a method to be available to all object instances, you have to add it to the prototype property.
-  When using `new`, `this` refers to the new empty object we create. However, if you don't add `new`, `this` refers to the global object!
- All objects have prototypes, except for the base object. 
- A very few objects, including `Object.prototype` itself, do not inherit from anything. This will only occur if the object is explicitly created with `Object.create(null)`.
- The strings and placeholders get passed to a function — either a default function, or a function you supply. To supply a function of your own, precede the template literal with a function name; the result is called a **tagged template**.
- When testing equality, primitives are compared by their value, while objects are compared by their reference. JavaScript checks if the objects have a reference to the same location in memory.
- An array is an object type.
- The data stored in `sessionStorage` is removed after closing the tab.
- With the `var` keyword, you can declare multiple variables with the same name.
- If you have two keys with the same name, the key will be replaced. It will still be in its first position, but with the last specified value.
- During event propagation, there are 3 phases: capturing, target, and bubbling. 
- You can stop bubbling by `event.stopPropagation`.
- The `apply()` method calls the specified function with a given `this` value, and arguments provided as an array (or an array-like object).
- The `call()` method calls the function with a given `this` value and arguments provided individually.
- The `bind()` method creates a new function that, when called, has its `this` keyword set to the provided value, with a given sequence of arguments preceding any provided when the new function is called.
- There are only 7 built-in types: `null`, `undefined`, `boolean`, `number`, `string`, `object`, and `symbol`. "function" is not a type, since functions are objects, it's of type "object".
- `setInterval()` returns a unique id. This id can be used to clear that interval with the `clearInterval()` function.
- Regular functions cannot be stopped mid-way after invocation. However, a generator function can be "stopped" midway, and later continue from where it stopped.
- With a `for-in` loop, we can iterate through object keys.
- Arguments are passed by value, unless their value is an object, then they're passed by reference.
- An exception can be a string, a number, a boolean or an object.
- When we try to invoke something that is not a `function`, a `TypeError` is thrown.
- An imported module is read-only: you cannot modify the imported module. Only the module that exports them can change its value.
- The `delete` operator returns a boolean value: `true` on a successful deletion, else it'll return `false`.
- Variables declared with the `var`, `const` or `let` keyword cannot be deleted using the `delete` operator.
- With the `defineProperty` method, we can add new properties to an object, or modify existing ones. When we add a property to an object using the `defineProperty` method, they are by default not enumerable. The `Object.keys` method returns all enumerable property names from an object.
