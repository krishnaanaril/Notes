# Microsoft Azure AI Fundamentals: Explore visual tools for machine learning

- There are two general approaches to machine learning, **supervised** and **unsupervised** machine learning. 
- The supervised machine learning approach requires you to start *with* a dataset with known label values. Two types of supervised machine learning tasks include **regression** and **classification**.
- The unsupervised machine learning approach starts with a dataset *without* known label values. One type of unsupervised machine learning task is **clustering**.
- Azure Automated Machine Learning - For people with a data science and programming background, it provides a way to save time and resources by automating algorithm selection and hyperparameter tuning.
