- The Anomaly Detector service will provide the best results if your time series data is evenly distributed. If the data is more randomly distributed, you can use an aggregation method to create a more even distribution data set.
- The Anomaly Detector detects anomalies automatically in time series data. It supports two basic detection models. One is for detecting a batch of data with a model trained by the time series sent to the service. The other is used for detecting the last point with the model trained by points before.
