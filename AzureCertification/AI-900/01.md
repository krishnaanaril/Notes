## Getting started with AI on Azure

- In Microsoft Azure, the **Anomaly Detector** service provides an application programming interface (API) that developers can use to create anomaly detection solutions.
- Microsoft Azure provides the following cognitive services to help you create computer vision solutions:
    - Computer Vision
    - Custom Vision
    - Face
    - Form Recognizer
- Microsoft Azure provides the following cognitive services to help you create computer vision solutions:
    - Language
    - Translator
    - Speech
    - Azure Bot
- Six principles of responsible AI
    - Fairness
    - Reliablity & Saftey
    - Privacy & Security
