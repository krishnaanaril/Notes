# Prepare for AI engineering

- **Data science** is a discipline that focuses on the processing and analysis of data; applying statistical techniques to uncover and visualize relationships and patterns in the data, and defining experimental models that help explore those patterns.
- **Machine learning** is a subset of data science that deals with the training and validation of *predictive* models. 
- **Artificial intelligence** usually (but not always) builds on machine learning to create software that emulates one or more characteristics of human intelligence.
- Considerations for responsible AI
    - Fairness
    - Reliablity & safety
    - Privacy & Security
    - Inclusiveness
    - Transparency
    - Accountability
- Azure Machine Learning provides the following features and capabilities:
    - Automated machine learning
    - Azure Machine learning designer
    - Data and compute management
    - Pipelines
-  **Azure Applied AI Services** provide out-of-the-box solutions for common AI scenarios. Applied AI Services include:
    - Azure Form Recognizer
    - Azure Metrics Advisor
    - Azure Video Analyzer for Media
    - Azure Immersive Reader
    - Azure Bot Service
    - Azure Cognitive Search
- Machine learning models are trained using historic data, and rely on algorithms that find statistical relationships in the data. Predictions are generally based on probability; and while models are often extremely accurate, predictions are based on a confidence score that indicates a level of probability.
