# Build a question answering solution

- The question answering capability of the **Language** service is a newer version of the **QnA** Service, which still exists as a standalone service. 
- The response for a question includes the closest question match that was found in the knowledge base, along with the associated answer, the confidence score, and other metadata about the question and answer pair.
- After creating and testing a knowledge base, you can improve its performance with *active learning* and by defining *synonyms*.
- You can create a knowledge base from an existing document or web page.
- To add a multi-turn context to a question, define a follow-up prompt.
