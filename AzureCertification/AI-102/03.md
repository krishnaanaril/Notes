# Process and translate text with Azure Cognitive Services

- To use the Language service to analyze text, you must provision a resource for it in your Azure subscription. You can provision a single-service **Language** resource, or you can use a multi-service **Cognitive Services** resource.
- The Language service recognizes up to 120 languages.
- If you submit textual content that the analyzer is not able to parse, for example because of character encoding issues when converting the text to a string variable. As a result, the response for the language name and ISO code will indicate (unknown) and the score value will be returned as `NaN`, or Not a Number. 
- The maximum size that can be analyzed (text analyze) is 5,120 characters
-  Linked entities enable you to disambiguate common entities of the same name.
- The Translator Azure Cognitive Service provides an API for translating text between 90 supported languages.
- To understand the relationship between the characters in the source text and the corresponding characters in the translation, you can specify the **includeAlignment** parameter with a value of **true**.
- You can handle profanities by specifying the profanityAction parameter, which can have one of the following values:
    - NoAction
    - Deleted
