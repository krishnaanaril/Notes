# Extract text from images and documents

- The Computer Vision service offers two APIs that you can use to read text.
    - The Read API (Asynchronous call)
    - The Image Aanlysis API (Still in preview - synchronous)
- The results of from the Read API are broken down by *page*, then *line*, and then *word*. 
- The Image Analysis API can't be used to process PDF formatted files.
- Uses of the Form Recognizer service include:
    - Process automation
    - Knowledge mining
    - Industry-specific applications
- **Form Recognizer** uses Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capabilities and deep learning models to extract text, key-value pairs, selection marks, and tables from documents.
-  Form Recognizer provides underlying models that have been trained on thousands of form examples. The underlying models enable you to do high-accuracy data extraction from your forms with little to no model training.
- Form Recognizer is composed of the following services:
    - Document analysis models:
    - Prebuilt models:
    - Custom models: 
- You can generate an ocr.json file for each sample form using the Form Recognizer's Analyze document function.
- There are two types of underlying models for custom forms *custom template models* or *custom neural models*.
- The labels needed in training are referenced in the ocr.json files, labels.json files, and single fields.json file.
