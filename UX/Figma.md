# [Figma UI UX Essentials](https://eylearning.udemy.com/course/figma-ux-ui-design-user-experience-tutorial-course)

- UI is what it looks like and UX is how it works.
- Types of mockups
    1. Low fidelity
    2. High fidelity
- First create a new design file from 'drafts'
- Think of a 'frame' as a page.
- Use Edit -> Copy/Paste properties to copy and apply properties from one object to another.
- Use Ctrl+D to repeat the last operation.
- Use cross to denote an image in log-fidelity design
- Use scale tool to scale an element or group of elements.
- Both `Frame` and `Group` can be used to club elements. 
- If we delete the inner elements `Group` will get deleted, but `Frame` do not.
- The main difference between `Frame` and `Group` is that `Frame` can be used to mask inner elements (clip content).
- Ungroup works for both `Frame` and `Group`
- Use right click -> Detach instance to separate SVG elements from its background.
- For desktop design grid column is selected as 12, because that is the industry standard and easy to divide the screen.
- Put margins and columns first, before you start designing.
- 24 is the common size for gutter in a 12 column setup for desktop.
- Android/iOS, 8 is the default grid column size
- Ctrl+Shift+4 for show/hide layout grids.
- Shift+1 -> Zoom to fit
- Use Ctrl+/ for command search
- Use Right click + Outline as stroke to edit fonts - to design logos
- Select View -> Show Outlines (Shift+O) for viewing outline.
- Flatten is different from union that it is destructive and removes outlines. Usually done after boolean operation like Union/Intersection/Exclude.
- You can use fill property of an object to add image.
- Use auto-layout to arrange a set of items in a frame
- In components, you can adjust the instance and then push back the changes to main component.
- If you've selected multiple components, you can create multiple components
- Alt+Drag to create instance of a component.
- If atleast one instance is alive, we can restore the main component.
- We can detach isntance and then add it as a local component, if you are getting a component from external source.
- Use slash (/) naming convention to automatically group components.
- The difference between 'Drafs' and project section in Figma is that, one is private and the other one is public. 
- Project is required to have another designer work on the same file. But Drafts can be shared with others for view only purpose.
