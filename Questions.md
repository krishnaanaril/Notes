    * WCF also provides REST based API using WebHttpBinding, but Web API has more features.
    * WCF supports multiple protocols, while Web API supports http only.
    * Web API is suitable for clients with less bandwidth as it uses less bandwidth. This is not the case with WCF service. 
    * Letter comparsion - WCF is like a letter inside an envelope while Web API is like a postcard. Here SOAP adds another layer (envelope).
